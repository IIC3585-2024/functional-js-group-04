Learning to walk again

> A million miles away Your signal in the distance To whom it may concern I think I lost my way Getting good at starting over Every time that I return Learning to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? Learning to talk again Can't you see I've waited long enough? Where do I begin?
